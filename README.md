### Recommended reading:
This field is highlight interdisciplinary, as such there is no single textbook that covers all our lectures, but here are some guidelines:

#### Theoretical neuroscience:
*Theoretical Neuroscience* by P Dayan and L F Abbott (MIT Press 2001) is recommended reading, see also the list of errata.<br>
*Neuronal Dynamics* by Wulfram Gerstner, Werner M. Kistler, Richard Naud and Liam Paninski. Full version online. <br>
*Introduction To The Theory Of Neural Computation*, Volume I by John Hertz. (Classical and accessible book on neural computation)<br>

#### Machine/statistical Learning:
General ML book: *Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms* by David MacKay<br>
Deep Learning (including Recurrent neural nets): *Deep Learning* by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville<br>
Unsupervised learning: *Natural Image Statistics* by Aapo Hyvarinen, Jarmo Hurri, and Patrik O. Hoyer. Full version online.<br>
Reinforcement learning: *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction* by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. Full version online.<br><br>
